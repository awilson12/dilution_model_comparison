# dilution_model_comparison

This code is for a manuscript under review,
Wilson AM, Jones RM. Spatial averaging of contamination in indirect contact exposure models and implications for dose. Environmental Science & Technology. Under review.


Main_code.R is for the primary models (A-C), while sensitivity_analysis.R (which sources main_code_v2.R) is for models C1-C6. These two files will source other files contained in the repository for randomly sampling values for parameters to inform first order rates, calculations of the rates, development of the transitional probability matrices, and running the simulation code. Code for figures and summary statistics are within the main files (main_code.R and sensitivity_analysis.R).
